<h3>RCS EXAMPLES</h3>
Boston University Research Computing Services (RCS) examples are provided to assist you in learning the software and the development of your applications on the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/tech/about/research/computation/scc/">Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)</a>. The instructions provided along with the code assume that the underlying OS is Linux. If these examples are run on a different architecture, you might need to make some changes to the code and/or the way the program is built and executed. 

<P>
Please note that all of the examples material is available either over the web
starting at 
<a href="http://scv.bu.edu/examples/">http://scv.bu.edu/examples/</a> or, for
those with Boston University Shared Computing Cluster accounts, you can also 
access the materials starting at the directory <b>/project/scv/examples/</b>
and using normal Linux commands to move between directories and copy files.</P>

<h4>Directory Structure:</h4>
There is a directory for each application or programming language for which we have example material.<br><br>

Within each of those directories are two directories:
<ul>
<li><em>examples</em>: Simple examples of using the application or programming language.</li>
<li><em>tutorials</em>: Examples used in RCS tutorials.  The slides for these tutorials are generally available at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/training-consulting/live-tutorials/">http://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/training-consulting/live-tutorials/</a> and if any live versions of the tutorial are scheduled, they will be listed at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/tech/about/training/classroom/rcs-tutorials/">http://www.bu.edu/tech/about/training/classroom/rcs-tutorials/</a>.</li>
</ul>
Each leaf directory contains a sample program(s), makefile (if necessary), script file(s) (if necessary) and README file (named README.html and/or Readme) that describes the files contained in the directory and commands needed to build and execute the program.
